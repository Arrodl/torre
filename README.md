The goal is for us to get an idea of your skills/strengths in the areas of web development, software architecture, algorithms, innovation, strategic thinking, autonomy, learning, attention to detail, and communication. If you join our team, you'll be working on the full stack. As such, we'll be evaluating your potential in both front and back end development.

You can access these endpoints:
- GET https://torre.bio/api/bios/$username (gets bio information of $username)
- GET https://torre.co/api/opportunities/$id (gets job information of $id)
- POST https://search.torre.co/opportunities/_search/?[offset=$offset&size=$size&aggregate=$aggregate] and https://search.torre.co/people/_search/?[offset=$offset&size=$size&aggregate=$aggregate] (search for jobs and people in general).
If you need examples of how they work, you can check the page network requests in your browser when retrieving or modifying information.

Create a search, redesign the genome, redesign the job listings, perform data analysis, develop new functionality, etc. Long story short: anything you would like to build.

You can invest as much time as you'd like. Please log your progress. You have 72 hours to complete it.
