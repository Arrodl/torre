The goal is for us to get an idea of your skills/strengths in the areas of web development, software architecture, algorithms, innovation, strategic thinking, autonomy, learning, attention to detail, and communication. If you join our team, you'll be working on the full stack. As such, we'll be evaluating your potential in both front and back end development.

You can access these endpoints:
- GET https://torre.bio/api/bios/$username (gets bio information of $username)
- GET https://torre.co/api/opportunities/$id (gets job information of $id)
- POST https://search.torre.co/opportunities/_search/?[offset=$offset&size=$size&aggregate=$aggregate] and https://search.torre.co/people/_search/?[offset=$offset&size=$size&aggregate=$aggregate] (search for jobs and people in general).
If you need examples of how they work, you can check the page network requests in your browser when retrieving or modifying information.

Create a search, redesign the genome, redesign the job listings, perform data analysis, develop new functionality, etc. Long story short: anything you would like to build.

You can invest as much time as you'd like. Please log your progress. You have 72 hours to complete it.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
